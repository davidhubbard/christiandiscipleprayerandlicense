# Christian Disciple Prayer and License

Please read the license! It is hopefully readable - especially the preamble.

* [LICENSE.md](LICENSE.md).

### Ok, I still have questions

**1. Do I have to publicly confess Jesus Christ to use something licensed with this license?**

No. This license extends the freedom to choose to every person, everywhere.
You may have the benefits of this license without ever publicly adhering to
any system of belief.

Quoting from the preamble:

> this license and prayer are framed with these values in mind:
>
> 1. Extend the freedom to choose this software, license and prayer to every
>    person, everywhere.
>
> 2. Extend the freedom to alter this software, except to alter it in a way that
>    violates these values.
>
> 3. Attempt adherence and discipleship to Christian values when using or
>    altering this software. This extends the freedom to contributors, users and
>    observers to choose knowing what values will be attempted now and in the
>    future arising from their participation with this software.

**2. Do I have to publicly confess Jesus Christ to file a complaint/bug/feature request?**

No, though each individual project may require it or any other requirement or rules.
Strictly speaking, each project is its own community and how each community is run isn't
governed or addressed here. They are free to accept or reject submissions - it
is out of scope for this license.

This git repository does not require other copies of this same license to follow its
rules or accept changes to the license text. In fact, each copy of this license must
be customized to the project before it is even usable at all.

For submissions to this git repository, the rules are:

1. Be respectful of others
2. Off-topic questions about religion, politics, and so forth are out of scope

**3. How is this different from a Free Software license?**

It adds a new feature to the license. The license incorporates a statement of purpose.
This benefits everyone: the developers, the users, even outside observers. Christianity
helps give deeper contextual meaning to the statements.

Check out the license text. It is hopefully readable:
